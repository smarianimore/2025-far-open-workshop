# Credits

Reveal.js template presentation as a GitHub repo Template: [here](https://github.com/pacharanero/create-new-revealjs-template)

* Includes Reveal.js as a Git submodule so that its commit history is not confused with this presentation's history
* Makes future updating of Reveal.js version very easy
* Reduces the size of the presentation repositories significantly

## Usage

* **Do not forget**: If you clone the repo locally you also need to get the submodule files with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* You may get Dependabot alerts from GitHub to warn you of vulnerabilities in the Reveal.js code. To make these go away, update the submodule.
* Use the command `git submodule update --rebase --remote` in the **root** of the repository (not the submodule directory) to update.
